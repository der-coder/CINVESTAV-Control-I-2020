\item [3.4] Consider an $n \times m$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$
with $n \geq m$. If all columns of $\mathbf{A}$ are
orthonormal, then $\mathbf{A}' \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}_m$. What can you say about
$\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}'$?\\

The result of $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}'$ will be a $n \times n$
matrix with values different from the identity
matrix of the same dimensions
($\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}' \neq \mathbf{I}_n$).
This is due to the fact that while the
\emph{columns} of A are orthogonal to one another,
its \emph{rows} are not orthogonal to one another.
As such, the product of its rows will yield a result
different to the identity matrix.
