\item [3.7] Consider the linear algebraic equation

\begin{equation*}
 \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & -1\\
  -3 & 3\\
  -1 & 2
 \end{bmatrix}
x =
\begin{bmatrix}
 1\\
 0\\
 1
\end{bmatrix}
= y
\end{equation*}

It has three equations and two unkowns.
Does a solution x exist in the equations?
Is the solution unique?
Does a solution exist if $y = [1 1 1]'$?
